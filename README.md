# Gesture2Vec: Clustering Gestures using Representation Learning Methods for Co-speech Gesture Generation

## The Best Paper Award Winner in Cognitive Robotics at IROS2022

This is an official PyTorch implementation of _Gesture2Vec: Clustering Gestures using Representation Learning Methods for Co-speech Gesture Generation_ (IROS 2022). In this paper, we present an automatic gesture generation model that uses a vector-quantized variational autoencoder structure as well as training techniques to learn a rigorous representation of gesture sequences. We then translate input text into a discrete sequence of associated gesture chunks in the learned gesture space. Subjective and objective evaluations confirm the success of our approach in terms of appropriateness, human-likeness, and diversity. We also introduce new objective metrics using the quantized gesture representation.
